Build a fun quiz game in the console

1. Build a function constructor called Question to describe a question. A question should 
   include:
a) question itself
b) the answers from which the player can choose the correct one (choose an adequate data 
   structure here; array, object, etc.
c) correct answer ( I would use a number for this)

2. Create a couple of questions using the constructor
3. Store them all inside an array
4. Select one random question and log it on the console, together with the possible answers
   (each question should have a number) Hint: write a method for the question objects for
   this task.
5. Use the 'prompt' function to ask the user for the correct answer. The user should input
   the number for the correct answer as in task 4
6. Check if the answer is correct and print to the console whether the answer is correct
   or not. Hint: write another method for this.
7. Suppose this code would be a plugin for other programmers to use in their code. So make
   sure that all the code is private and doesn't interfere with other code. Hint: Use
   an IIFE.
8. After you display the result, display the next random question, so that the game never 
   ends. HINT: write a function for this and call it right after displaying the results.
9. Include the option to quit the game if the user writes quit instead of an answer. In 
   this case do not call the function from 8.
